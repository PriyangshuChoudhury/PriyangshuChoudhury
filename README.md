Hi there, I'm Priyangshu Choudhury! 👋
👨‍🔬 About Me
I am a recent graduate with a Master’s degree in Physics, specializing in research on fog and aerosol dynamics. Currently, I’m a project intern at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), where I work on understanding how hydrated aerosols impact atmospheric visibility and the spectral broadening of fog droplets in polluted urban environments. I am passionate about environmental science, data analysis, and building machine learning models for real-world applications.
